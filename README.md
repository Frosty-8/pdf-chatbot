## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Flask**  
  Lightweight web framework for Python.

- **PyPDF2**  
  For extracting and parsing text from PDF files.

- **Langchain**  
  Framework for building LLM-powered applications:
    - `CharacterTextSplitter`: Splits extracted text into manageable chunks.
    - `HuggingFaceEmbeddings`: Generates vector embeddings from text.
    - `FAISS`: Enables fast similarity search in vector spaces.
    - `ConversationalRetrievalChain`: Powers the conversational Q&A experience.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run PDFChatApp locally.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- `pip` (Python package installer)
- Node.js & npm (for frontend assets, only if you modify styles)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
    ```
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <repository_name>
    ```

2. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment**
    ```
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows:
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux:
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3. **Install Python Dependencies**
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **(Optional) Install Frontend Dependencies**
    If you plan to modify the CSS/UI:
    ```
    npm install
    ```

---

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following content:

```bash
OPENROUTER_API_KEY="your_openrouter_api_key_here"
YOUR_SITE_URL="http://127.0.0.1:5000" # Or your deployed site URL
YOUR_SITE_NAME="PDFChatApp" # A descriptive name for your application
```


- Obtain your `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` from [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/).

---

### Running the Application

1. **Start the Flask App**
    ```
    python app.py
    ```
    Or use the Makefile:
    ```
    make run
    ```
    The app will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

2. **Build Tailwind CSS (if you modify `input.css`)**
    ```
    npm run build-css
    ```
    The `build-css` script includes `--watch` for automatic recompilation.

---

## üí° Usage

1. **Upload PDFs**  
   Go to the home page (`/`) and upload one or more PDF documents.

2. **Processing**  
   The app extracts and processes text, creating a searchable knowledge base.

3. **Chat & Ask Questions**  
   Once processing is done, you'll be redirected to the chat page. Ask questions about your PDFs and get instant answers.

4. **View Conversation History**  
   Scroll through your chat to see previous questions and answers.

5. **Reset Session / Upload New PDFs**  
   Click "Upload a Different PDF" to clear your session and start over.

---

## üßπ Cleaning Up

To remove the virtual environment and compiled Python files:

```bash
make clean
```

## üìù Advanced Tips & Notes

- **Scaling**:  
  For production, consider using a production-ready WSGI server (e.g., Gunicorn) and configuring secure file storage.

- **Customization**:  
  You can easily extend the UI or backend logic to support additional file types, answer formatting, or citation features.

- **Security**:  
  Uploaded PDFs are processed per session and not shared. For sensitive data, ensure your deployment environment is secure.

- **Performance**:  
  For large documents or many concurrent users, consider using persistent vector stores and optimizing embedding/model calls.
